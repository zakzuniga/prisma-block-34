# 34B Authentication & OAuth

You have two main tasks for this workshop:

1. Use `bcrypt` to encrypt user passwords. Only encrypted passwords should be stored in the database. When a user tries to log in, compare the password they provide with what's stored in the database.

2. _Add_ the option for users to authenticate via Github OAuth. They should still have the ability to register and login with a username and password.

The [Github documentation on building OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps) will be very useful to reference.
