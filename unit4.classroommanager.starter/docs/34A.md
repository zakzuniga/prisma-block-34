# 34A Database Abstractions with Prisma

Your task for this workshop is to **refactor the existing codebase to integrate [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**. This will entail updating _only_ the backend code. Before you change anything, run the server and client to see how the app currently works. The app's functionality **should not** be affected by your changes.

[Prisma's getting started guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) will be very helpful! There are also many helpful articles under the Guides and Reference sections, so be sure to check those out as well.

> You can follow the guide for either starting from scratch or adding to an existing project; if you do the latter, you can ignore the portion about baselining your database.
