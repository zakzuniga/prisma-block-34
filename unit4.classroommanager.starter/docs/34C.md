# 34C Backend Testing

For this workshop, your task is to add test suites to the backend. These tests do not need to be comprehensive, but try your best to test as many different situations as possible!

Refer to [the Prisma documentation on testing](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing#example-unit-tests) and [the SuperTest documentation](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest) as you work on this workshop.
